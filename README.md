# Flow
A first-person movement game

## Default Binds  
### Movement
- Run: WASD
- Jump: Space
- Crouch/slide: Ctrl
- Dash: Left Shift
  
### Application  
- Menu/Unlock Cursor: Escape

## Mechanics
- Dash: Input the dash while mid-air. You will dash in whatever direction you are inputting, not just where you are looking.
Slide: Run forward until you build up enough speed and then hold the crouch/slide input. You can get more speed/distance by jumping out of the slide at the right time to avoid ground friction.
- Wall Climb: Run forward whilst facing a wall. Your vertical acceleration wanes as you climb but returns over time while you are not climbing. Wall bouncing will tire out your climb energy.
- Wall Bounce: Whilst climbing, hold jump.
- Wall Run: Whilst climbing, face parallel to the wall. It is much faster to move diagonally into the wall.
- Air Strafe: Develop at least some speed, then let go of the forward input and instead hold a sideways input while very gradually looking in that direction. You will be able to accelerate beyond the maximum speed you could otherwise achieve through running alone. You can alternate directions to go in a relatively straight path.
